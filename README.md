# Lung-Cancer-Identification

Given the complexities of lung cancer classification and the limits of present procedures, new clinical data assessment tools are needed to supplement biopsy and help better identify disease features. We use current advancements in deep learning to contribute significantly to improving accuracy and sensitivity in the early stages of cancer in this work. For this task we are working on a Lung Cancer Image Dataset collected from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/balasubramaniamv/lung-cancer-dataset/version/1) comprising 9717 files.
